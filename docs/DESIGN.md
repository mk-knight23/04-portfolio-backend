# Design System: 04-portfolio-site-v1

## Visual Philosophy
The design focuses on **Editorial Clarity**. It uses a clean, grid-based layout that prioritizes readability and content structure, inspired by modern developer blogs.

## Design Patterns
-   **Sidebar Navigation**: A dark-themed persistent sidebar for branding and navigation.
-   **Grid Layout**: A subtle grid background in the header for a "technical" feel.
-   **Typography**: High-contrast headings (Black weight) for a strong visual hierarchy.

## Color Palette
-   **Background**: Sky Gray (#f8fafc)
-   **Sidebar**: Slate Black (#020617)
-   **Accents**: Blue (#2563eb) for primary actions.
-   **Text**: Deep Slate (#0f172a) for primary reading.

## Interaction Design
-   **Hover Transitions**: Subtle scaling and color shifts on article cards.
-   **Motion**: Smooth staggered entrances for the blog feed.
-   **Responsiveness**: Fluid transition from vertical sidebar to top-navigation on mobile.
